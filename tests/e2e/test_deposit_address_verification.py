"""
End-to-end test for the Layer 4 deposit-address verifier.

Background
==========

Prior to commit 2568367b, ``jm-wallet info`` would propose a new deposit
address using only the in-memory ``addresses_with_history`` set populated
by the bulk sync. If the bulk walk was incomplete (RPC truncation,
bitcoind socket drop mid-pagination, persisted store predating a node
reindex, etc.), a previously-funded address could be re-proposed,
linking the new sender to the prior coin's history.

The fix verifies each candidate address against bitcoind via
``getreceivedbyaddress addr 0`` immediately before handing it out
(``DescriptorWalletBackend.address_has_history``).

This test verifies that method against a real regtest node:

  1. Funding a receive address (confirmed) -> ``address_has_history``
     returns ``True``.
  2. Funding a receive address that is still in the mempool ->
     ``address_has_history`` returns ``True`` (minconf=0 is critical;
     even a mempool funding leaks privacy on reuse).
  3. A freshly generated, never-funded address ->
     ``address_has_history`` returns ``False``.
  4. RPC failure (closed client) -> returns ``None`` so callers can
     degrade gracefully rather than block or false-fail.

Without this defense, the verifier could silently accept funded
addresses and the bulk-sync incompleteness would translate directly
into a privacy leak.

Requires: docker compose up -d (the default ``jm-bitcoin`` regtest node).
